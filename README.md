# MLPlayground

In this repository I keep a collection of ML algorithms I'm particularly interested in. I started with RL as this was a substantial part of my master's thesis. Additionally, I'm planning to incorporate some DL architectures solving computer vision problems. As a next step I would also like to include more traditional algorithms from the ML community. 

Currently all DL code is written using PyTorch.
